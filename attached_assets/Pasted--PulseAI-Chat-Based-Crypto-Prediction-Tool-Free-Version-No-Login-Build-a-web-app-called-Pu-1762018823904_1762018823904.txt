⚡ PulseAI — Chat-Based Crypto Prediction Tool (Free Version, No Login)

Build a web app called “PulseAI”, an AI-powered chatbot that predicts short-term crypto market movements through a simple chat interface (like Discord or Telegram).

The goal is to let users freely chat with the bot, ask for crypto predictions, and receive realistic analysis messages — no login, no landing page, no monetization.

🧱 Core Features

Chat Interface (Main UI)

A one-page web app with a modern, Discord-style dark theme.

Messages alternate between user and AI bot.

User can type messages or choose from quick-select buttons for crypto pairs like:

BTC/USDT

ETH/USDT

BNB/USDT

SOL/USDT

XRP/USDT

DOGE/USDT

ADA/USDT

Bot replies naturally, e.g.:

“Analysing BTC/USDT…”
“✅ Prediction: UP in the next 45 seconds — Confidence: 82%.”
“Suggested trade: SHORT duration, moderate volatility.”

AI Prediction Logic (Simulated for MVP)

Generate realistic random predictions with:

Direction: UP or DOWN

Confidence score (0–100%)

Duration (15s, 30s, 1m, etc.)

Keep prediction logic modular so it can later be replaced by a real data model.

Add short “typing” or “analysing…” delays for realism.

Interaction Flow

User starts by pressing a “Start” button or sending a message.

Bot introduces itself:

“Hey there 👋 I’m PulseAI — I analyse crypto markets in real time. Pick a pair and I’ll show you my prediction.”

After each result, bot suggests next actions like “Check another pair” or “Run another analysis.”

Optional Features (still simple)

Command /history to show the last 5 predictions.

Refresh or “New Session” button to clear chat.

Timestamp beside each message.

No Login / No Signup / No Landing Page

The app opens directly to the chat screen.

Everything runs locally or via lightweight backend simulation.

100% free and publicly accessible.

💻 Tech Stack Recommendation

Frontend: React or Next.js + Tailwind CSS

Backend (optional): Node.js or Python FastAPI for simulated predictions

Realtime: WebSockets or simple setTimeout delays for message flow
